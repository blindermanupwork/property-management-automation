ORIGINAL PROBLEM ANALYSIS:
- User said record 37717 should be marked as removed
- User disagreed that Airbnb changes UIDs for reservations
- 0 removals were happening in the logs

WHAT I DISCOVERED:
1. UIDs in Airtable are already in composite format (uid_propertyId)
2. Processing creates composite UIDs (uid_propertyId) 
3. The comparison should work correctly

BUT THE REAL ISSUE WAS:
- My "fix" tried to composite already-composite UIDs
- This created double-composite UIDs that never matched
- Result: ALL records marked as removed (433 records)

THE ORIGINAL ISSUE (record 37717) MIGHT BE:
1. A genuine case where the record should be removed
2. OR there's a more subtle bug in the removal logic
3. OR there's an edge case with specific UID formats

Let me check if record 37717 actually exists and what its status is...
