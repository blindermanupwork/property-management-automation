# Job Template Extraction - Final Summary Report

**Date**: June 16, 2025  
**Project**: HousecallPro Job Template ID Extraction for Airtable Properties

## 📋 Executive Summary

Successfully extracted job template IDs from HousecallPro for 191 properties by analyzing their historical job data. The system identified the most recent job of each type (Turnover, Inspection, Return Laundry) for each property and updated the Airtable properties CSV with these template IDs.

## 🎯 What We Did

### 1. **Data Extraction Pipeline**
- Created a 3-step automated pipeline:
  - Step 1: Fetched ALL jobs for 126 unique customers (20,000+ total jobs)
  - Step 2: Filtered jobs by property address (189 properties with jobs)
  - Step 3: Identified job templates using pattern matching

### 2. **Pattern Recognition**
Identified jobs by type using these patterns:
- **Turnover**: Jobs containing " ng ", "next guest", or "sameday" (excluding inspections/laundry)
- **Inspection**: Jobs containing "inspection"
- **Return Laundry**: Jobs containing "return laundry"

### 3. **Template Selection**
- Selected the MOST RECENT job of each type as the template
- Excluded canceled/deleted jobs from consideration
- Prioritized completed jobs with valid descriptions

## 📊 Results

### Overall Statistics:
- **Total Properties Processed**: 191
- **Properties with Jobs**: 189 (98.9%)
- **Success Rates by Template Type**:
  - ✅ **Turnover Templates Found**: 186/191 (97.4%)
  - ✅ **Inspection Templates Found**: 180/191 (94.2%)
  - ✅ **Return Laundry Templates Found**: 161/191 (84.3%)
- **Properties with ALL 3 Templates**: 159/191 (83.2%)

### Key Findings:
1. **Return Laundry** is the least common service type (30 properties don't have it)
2. **iTrip properties** (customer: cus_143035dc029211e989960294c7939904) often lack Return Laundry services
3. Some properties have specialized cleaning arrangements that don't fit standard patterns
4. Properties with <10 jobs were more likely to be missing templates

## 📁 Final Deliverables

### 1. **Updated Properties CSV**
`Prod_Airtable_Properties_Updated.csv`
- Contains all original columns PLUS:
  - Column 12: `Turnover Job Template ID`
  - Column 15: `Inspection Job Template ID`
  - Column 16: `Return Laundry Job Template ID`

### 2. **Customers CSV**
`Prod_Airtable_Customers.csv`
- Original customer data (unchanged)
- Kept for reference with properties

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### API Integration:
- Used HousecallPro Production API with Token authentication
- Implemented pagination (200 jobs per page) with rate limiting
- Handled 13,000+ jobs for single customers efficiently

### Data Processing:
- JSON storage for intermediate results
- CSV manipulation preserving all original data
- Pattern matching with regex for job categorization

### Error Handling:
- Graceful handling of missing data
- Continued processing despite individual failures
- Comprehensive logging throughout

## 📈 Properties Missing Templates

### Missing All Templates (5 properties):
1. **Frank Lloyd Wright Condo** - Special cleaning instructions only
2. **Luton** - No jobs found
3. **Parkview Villas #201** - Only initial service
4. **Red Wheel VR** - Missing customer/address IDs
5. **Slice of Paradise** - Only canceled jobs

### Missing Specific Templates:
- **No Turnover**: 5 properties (edge cases)
- **No Inspection**: 11 properties (6% of total)
- **No Return Laundry**: 30 properties (16% of total)

## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Manual Review**: The 5 properties with no templates may need manual template assignment
2. **Return Laundry**: Consider if all properties need this service type
3. **Data Quality**: Some properties have inconsistent job descriptions that could be standardized
4. **Future Automation**: This process can be repeated periodically to update templates for new properties

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Import `Prod_Airtable_Properties_Updated.csv` to Airtable
2. Verify template IDs are correctly linked in HousecallPro
3. Test job creation with the extracted templates
4. Monitor properties without templates for future job creation
