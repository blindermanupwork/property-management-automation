# System Improvement Recommendations

## Executive Summary
Based on Veronica's workflow analysis, here are the critical features to build next to complete the automation and improve operational efficiency.

## ðŸ”´ Critical Missing Features (Build First)

### 1. Late Checkout Alert System
**Problem**: Owners communicate late checkouts to Veronica manually, causing scheduling conflicts
**Solution**: 
- Webhook or email parser for owner communications
- Auto-update cleaning times when late checkout approved
- Alert system for same-day turnarounds affected by late checkouts
- SMS/Push notifications to assigned cleaners

### 2. Special Request Automation
**Current Gap**: "Clean extra good", "move furniture", "bring extra linens" are buried in messages
**Build**:
- Keyword detection in guest/owner messages
- Auto-tagging system for request types
- Cleaner skill matching (who can handle furniture moving?)
- Additional time allocation for special requests

### 3. Owner Block Communication System
**Issue**: Veronica manually contacts owners about post-block cleaning
**Solution**:
- Automated email/SMS templates when blocks end
- Response tracking system
- Auto-convert to cleaning job when owner confirms
- Reminder system for no-response blocks

## ðŸŸ¡ High-Priority Enhancements

### 4. Intelligent Cleaner Assignment
**Current**: Manual assignment every morning
**Upgrade to**:
- Auto-assign based on:
  - Cleaner location/territory
  - Historical performance at property
  - Current workload
