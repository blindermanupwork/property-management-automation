**Version:** 2.0  
**Last Updated:** June 12, 2025  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive operational scenarios covering all aspects of property management operations - from routine scheduling to emergency situations, with real examples and detailed resolution steps

---

## üö® **Most Common Daily Scenarios (Top Priority)**

### 1. **Late Checkout Request from iTrip**
**Example:** Property at 5244 E Hartford Ave has checkout on June 22 at 10:00 AM, but guest requests 2:00 PM late checkout

**What Happens:**
- iTrip emails request for late checkout
- Existing job scheduled for 10:00 AM needs to be moved
- Next guest might be checking in same day (same-day turnover)

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Find reservation in Airtable (search by property address or date)
2. Update "Custom Service Time" to "2025-06-22 2:00 PM"
3. Click "Add/Update Schedule" button
4. Check if same-day turnover exists - may need to notify next guest

**Real Example:**
- Job ID: `job_0b2bf89c45594b35a7ccd9cefbc504c1`
- Original time: 10:00 AM ‚Üí Changed to: 2:00 PM
- Sync Status updates to show new time

---

### 2. **Special Cleaning Instructions Need to Be Added**
**Example:** Owner requests deep clean of kitchen appliances for their arrival

**What Happens:**
- Email received with special instructions
- Job already created but needs updated service details
- Instructions must be added before cleaner arrives

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Find reservation in Airtable
2. Add instructions to "Service Line Custom Instructions" field (200 char limit)
3. If job already exists, instructions can only be updated directly in HCP
4. For future jobs, add instructions before clicking "Create Job"

**Real Example:**
- iTrip Report Info: "The owner is staying in their home. Please make sure it's extra clean and ready!"
- Service Line becomes: "Deep clean appliances - Turnover STR Next Guest June 23"

---

### 3. **Reservation Modified After Job Created**
**Example:** Guest changes checkout from June 16 to June 17

**What Happens:**
- System marks reservation as "Modified" status
- Existing job in HCP is now on wrong date
- Sync Status shows "Wrong Date"

**Resolution Steps:**
1. System automatically detects change (every 4 hours)
2. Find record with Sync Status = "Wrong Date"
3. Update "Final Service Time" to new checkout date + 10:00 AM
4. Click "Add/Update Schedule" button
5. Verify Sync Status changes to "Synced"

**Real Example:**
- Job: `job_5fa097ea775d4b438ae1de1a85f03a4a`
- Sync Details: "Schedule date doesn't match: expected 2025-06-17, found 2025-06-16"

---

### 4. **Same-Day Turnover Detected**
**Example:** Checkout at 2065 W 1st Pl on June 22, new guest checking in same day

**What Happens:**
- System auto-detects same-day turnover
- Sets early morning time (8:00 AM) for cleaning
- High priority - limited time window

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Filter Airtable for "Same-day Turnover" = true
2. Verify early morning schedule (8:00 AM default)
3. Assign experienced cleaner who can work quickly
4. Monitor job progress closely
5. Alert if running late - affects check-in

**Real Example:**
- Customer: Kathy Nelson property
- Service Line: "Turnover STR SAME DAY"
- Must complete by 2:00 PM for 3:00 PM check-in

---

### 5. **Job Not Completed Yesterday**
**Example:** Cleaner couldn't access property, job remains incomplete

**What Happens:**
- Job Status stays "In Progress" or "Scheduled"
- New guest arriving today
- Urgent rescheduling needed

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Check webhook logs for job status updates
2. Filter Airtable: Job Status != "Completed" AND Service Date = yesterday
3. Contact cleaner for explanation
4. Create urgent job for today morning
5. Notify property manager of delay

**Log Check Example:**
```bash
grep "job_763e1ad5e7334979af6caf6893c168a2" /home/opc/automation/src/automation/logs/webhook.log
```

1. Check current assignment in "Assignee" field
2. In HCP, reassign to available cleaner
3. Webhook automatically updates Airtable
4. Monitor "Sync Date and Time" for confirmation

---

### 7. **Owner Stay Requires Special Handling**
**Example:** Property owner staying after guest checkout

**What Happens:**
- iTrip marks as "Owner Stay"
- Requires premium service level
- Often has specific requirements

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Look for "Owner Stay" in iTrip Report Info
2. Add to Service Line Custom Instructions: "Owner arriving - extra attention to detail"
3. Assign most experienced cleaner
4. Set appropriate time (usually 11:00 AM)

---

## üîÑ **Sync and System Issues**

## üí° **Tips for Efficient Operations**

### Airtable Views for Quick Access:
1. **‚è∞‚ùå Incomplete** - Jobs that aren't finished yet
2. **‚è∞‚ùì Mismatch** - Schedule sync issues needing attention  
3. **‚è∞üóëÔ∏è Removed** - Canceled reservations to review
4. **‚è∞‚ö†Ô∏è Modified** - Reservations that changed after job creation
5. **‚¨ÜÔ∏èüßπ Upcoming** - Future cleanings to prepare for
6. **üè† iTrip** / **üè† Evolve** - Filter by booking source
7. **HCP Create Jobs** - Reservations ready for job creation

### Quick Filters to Save Daily:
1. **Urgent Today**: `AND({Check-out Date} = TODAY(), {Job Status} != "Completed")`
2. **Sync Issues**: `{Sync Status} != "Synced"`
3. **Same Day Rush**: `AND({Same-day Turnover} = TRUE, {Check-out Date} >= TODAY())`
4. **Modified Reservations**: `AND({Status} = "Modified", {Service Job ID} != "")`
5. **No Job Created**: `AND({Final Service Time} != "", {Service Job ID} = "")`

### Daily Checklist:
- [ ] 8:00 AM - Check same-day turnovers
- [ ] 9:00 AM - Review sync issues
- [ ] 12:00 PM - Verify morning completions
- [ ] 3:00 PM - Check afternoon schedules
