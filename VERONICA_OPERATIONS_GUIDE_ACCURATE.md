# Property Management Operations Guide
## **How Your Workflow Really Works**

*Veronica, this guide shows you exactly what the automation does and what you need to do each day.*

## üéØ **What's Actually Automated (The Big Wins)**

### ‚úÖ **Fully Automated - You Do Nothing:**
- **iTrip Email Processing**: All 100+ iTrip emails processed automatically daily
- **Evolve Data**: Reservations and blocks scraped automatically from Evolve portal
- **Calendar Sync**: All ICS feeds (Airbnb, Booking.com, etc.) processed every 30 minutes
- **Reservation Import**: New reservations appear in Airtable automatically

### üîß **Semi-Automated - You Click Buttons:**
- **Job Creation**: Reservations are imported, but you click "Create Job & Sync Status" button to make HCP jobs
- **Schedule Updates**: If you change times, you click "Add/Update Schedule" button to sync to HCP
- **Cleaner Assignment**: Cleaners assigned in HCP, then webhook updates Airtable automatically

---

## üìã **Your Actual Daily Workflow**

### **Morning Routine (8:00 AM):**

1. **Open Airtable** ‚Üí **Reservations** table
2. **Go to "üßπ Upcoming Cleanings (Next 7 Days)" view**
3. **Look for new reservations** (they'll be there automatically)
4. **For each new reservation:**
   - Click the **"Create Job & Sync Status"** button
   - Wait for it to sync (Sync Status will show "Synced")
   - Job now exists in HousecallPro

### **Assigning Cleaners:**
1. **Open HousecallPro** (not Airtable)
2. **Find the job** and assign cleaners
3. **Assignment automatically appears** in Airtable's "Assignee" field via webhook

1. **In Airtable**: Find the reservation
2. **Update "Custom Service Time" field** with new time
3. **Click "Add/Update Schedule" button** to sync to HCP
4. **Check "Sync Status"** field shows "Synced"

## üö´ **What Doesn't Work (Yet)**

### **Missing Features You Might Expect:**

- **No automatic late checkout detection** (you must update manually)
- **No automatic special request parsing** (you must add instructions)
- **No bulk job creation** (must click button for each reservation)

---

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **If Job Doesn't Sync:**
1. Check "Sync Status" field for error message
2. Verify property has valid HCP Customer ID and Address ID
3. Try clicking button again
4. Check HCP for duplicate jobs

### **If Cleaner Assignment Doesn't Appear:**
1. Assignment made in HCP? (not Airtable)
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for webhook
3. Check webhook logs if still missing

### **If Late Checkout Not Working:**
1. Did you set "Custom Service Time" field?
2. Did you click "Add/Update Schedule" button?
3. Check "Sync Status" shows "Synced"
