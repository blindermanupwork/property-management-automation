Comprehensive fix for Lodgify add/remove cycle

THE PROBLEM:
1. Lodgify changes UIDs every time the ICS feed is fetched
2. The system creates records with new UIDs
3. On next run, can't find those UIDs in the feed (they changed)
4. Marks them as removed
5. Creates new records with the new UIDs
6. Cycle repeats forever

THE SOLUTION:
When checking for removals, we need to:
1. Check if the record's property+dates+type exists in the current feed
2. If yes, don't mark as removed (even if UID changed)
3. This prevents the add/remove cycle

IMPLEMENTATION:
The LODGIFY FIX at line 1636 needs to be enhanced to:
1. Check ALL events in the current processing batch, not just the feed's events
2. Include events that were already processed and updated
