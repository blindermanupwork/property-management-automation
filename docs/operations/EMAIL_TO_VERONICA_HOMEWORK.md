**Subject: Important: Airtable Training Homework - Due Friday**

---

Hi Veronica,

I've created comprehensive training materials to help you master our Airtable system. This homework will ensure you understand every view and field we use for managing cleaning operations.

## üìã What You Need to Do

### 1. Read These Guides (In Order)
I've created three detailed guides for you. Please read them carefully:

**First:** Airtable Views Guide  
https://gist.github.com/blindermanupwork/d3b64ec830847805b847edf27af52b6c

**Second:** Airtable Fields Guide  
https://gist.github.com/blindermanupwork/daf1f9415df48ad9ec7032bb5a5903b1

**Third:** Your Homework Assignment (attached)

### 2. Complete Daily Exercises
The homework has specific tasks for each day this week:
- **Monday-Tuesday:** Explore all views and document what you find
- **Wednesday:** Field scavenger hunt and relationship mapping
- **Thursday:** Practice morning routine and job creation
- **Friday:** Document pain points and suggest improvements

### 3. Track Your Work
Each day, please log:
- How long tasks take you
- Which views you used
- Problems you encountered
- Questions that came up

## üéØ What I Need From You

By **Friday, June 21**, please send me:

1. **Your daily tracking sheets** - Simple notes on what you did each day

2. **Three real problems you solved** - Actual situations where you used the views to fix issues

3. **Your improvement ideas:**
   - One new view that would help you work faster
   - One missing field we should add
   - One workflow that needs improvement

4. **Your questions list** - Everything that confused you or wasn't clear

5. **Time audit** - How long different tasks take you (be honest!)

## üí° Why This Matters

This training will help you:
- Work faster and more independently
- Catch problems before guests complain
- Understand why the system works the way it does
- Suggest improvements based on your daily experience

## üì± Getting Help

- **Urgent questions:** Slack me immediately
- **Non-urgent questions:** Write them down for our Friday review
- **If you get stuck:** Try to figure it out first, then document what blocked you

## ‚è∞ Time Commitment

Plan for about 1 hour per day:
- 30 minutes for exercises
- 30 minutes for documentation

This is paid training time - track it as part of your work hours.

## üö® Important Notes

1. **You can't break anything** - Feel free to click around and explore
2. **Focus on understanding WHY** - Don't just memorize steps
3. **Your feedback matters** - If something doesn't make sense, we need to fix it
4. **This is about improving the system** - Your suggestions will help everyone

## üìÖ Friday Review Meeting

Let's plan to meet Friday afternoon to:
- Review your findings
- Discuss your improvement ideas
- Answer all your questions
- Plan system updates based on your feedback

Please confirm you received this and understand the assignment. Let me know if you need clarification on anything before you start.

Looking forward to your insights!

Thanks,
Boris
