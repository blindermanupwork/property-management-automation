## üõ†Ô∏è **Essential Tools to Master**

### Airtable Views
1. **Today's Jobs**: Service Date = TODAY()
2. **Sync Issues**: Sync Status != "Synced"  
3. **Unscheduled**: Job Status = "Unscheduled"
4. **Tomorrow Prep**: Service Date = TOMORROW()
5. **Weekly Overview**: Service Date = THIS WEEK()

### Key Formulas
```
// Time until service
DATETIME_DIFF({Final Service Time}, NOW(), 'hours')

// Days since created  
DATETIME_DIFF(NOW(), {Created}, 'days')

// Overdue jobs
AND({Service Date} < TODAY(), {Job Status} != "Completed")
```

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Today's automation log
cat /home/opc/automation/src/automation/logs/automation_prod_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).log

# Recent webhooks
tail -n 100 /home/opc/automation/src/automation/logs/webhook.log | grep -i error

# Service status
sudo systemctl status webhook airscripts-api
```
