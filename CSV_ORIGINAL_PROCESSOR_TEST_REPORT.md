# CSV Original Processor Test Report

## Executive Summary
**Status**: ✅ SUCCESS - Original processor working perfectly
**Version**: 2.2.9 (reverted from hybrid to stable)
**Test Date**: July 23, 2025

## Test Results

### Run 1: Fresh Import
- **iTrip Reservations**: 28 new ✅
- **iTrip Blocks**: 1 new ✅
- **Total Created**: 29 records
- **Status**: SUCCESS

### Run 2: Immediate Re-run
- **iTrip Reservations**: 28 unchanged ✅
- **iTrip Blocks**: 1 unchanged ✅
- **New/Modified/Removed**: 0 ✅
- **Status**: SUCCESS - Correctly detected all as unchanged

## Conclusion
The original CSV processor is working correctly:
1. Properly creates new records on first run
2. Correctly identifies unchanged records on subsequent runs
3. No false "modified" detections
4. Composite UID support working as expected

## Changes Made
1. Reverted csvProcess_enhanced.py to use original csvProcess.py
2. Removed all hybrid testing files and documentation
3. Updated VERSION back to 2.2.9
4. Cleaned up CLAUDE.md to remove hybrid references

## Recommendation
Continue using the original stable CSV processor. The hybrid approach complexity is not needed for CSV processing where we have consistent UID behavior from iTrip and Evolve.
