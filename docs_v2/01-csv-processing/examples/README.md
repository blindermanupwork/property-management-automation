## üîß Edge Cases

### Edge Case 1: UTF-8 Special Characters
```csv
Confirmation Code,Property ID,Property Name,Check In,Check Out,Nights,Guest First,Guest Last,Guest Email,Guest Phone,Adults,Children,Pets,Total Paid,Entry Source,Booking Date
"UTF123456","PROP_007","Ch√¢teau de la C√¥te d'Azur","07/14/2025","07/21/2025","7","Fran√ßois","M√ºller","francois@√©m√¢il.com","555-888-9999","2","0","0","3500.00","Airbnb","06/30/2025"
```

### Edge Case 2: Very Large CSV (1000+ rows)
- File size: 250KB+
- Processing time: ~45 seconds
- Memory usage peaks at 150MB
- Batch processing in chunks of 100

### Edge Case 3: Malformed CSV
```csv
Confirmation Code,Property ID,Property Name,Check In,Check Out
"BROKEN123","PROP_008","Missing quotes,06/25/2025,06/30/2025
"BROKEN456","PROP_009","Extra"Quote"Here","06/26/2025","06/28/2025"
```

**Recovery Strategy:**
- Secondary CSV parser with relaxed rules
- Manual quote escaping
- Row-by-row validation
