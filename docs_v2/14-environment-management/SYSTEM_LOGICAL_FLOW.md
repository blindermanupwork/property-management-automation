## ðŸš€ **ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT OPERATIONAL FLOW**

### **1. SYSTEM STARTUP AND ENVIRONMENT DETECTION FLOW**

**Initial Environment Detection Process:**
- System examines ENVIRONMENT variable first for explicit environment specification
- If ENVIRONMENT not set, automatic detection begins via hostname analysis
- Hostname checked for 'prod' or 'production' keywords to identify production systems
- Default fallback to 'development' environment if no clear indicators found
- Environment detection logged with timestamp and detection method used

**Configuration Class Selection Logic:**
- Development environment triggers DevConfig class instantiation
- Production environment triggers ProdConfig class instantiation
- Configuration wrapper creates singleton instance to prevent multiple config objects
- Selected configuration class inherits from ConfigBase for shared functionality
- Environment-specific methods override base implementation for specialized behavior

**Project Root Discovery Process:**
- System searches for setup.py file to identify pip-installed development environment
- VERSION file checked as secondary method for project root identification
- Git directory (.git) examined as tertiary method for repository-based detection
- Current working directory used as final fallback for project root location
- Project root path stored for all subsequent file and directory operations

### **2. CONFIGURATION LOADING AND VALIDATION FLOW**

**Hierarchical Configuration Loading Process:**
- Main .env file loaded from project root for shared environment variables
- Environment-specific .env file loaded with override capability for targeted settings
- Environment variables merged with later sources taking precedence over earlier sources
- Configuration validation runs immediately after loading to detect issues early
- Missing or invalid configuration triggers clear error messages with remediation guidance

**Credential and Security Management:**
- API keys loaded from environment-specific variables (DEV_ vs PROD_ prefixes)
- Airtable base IDs validated for proper format and length requirements
- HousecallPro tokens verified for presence and basic format compliance
- Webhook secrets checked for configuration completeness
- Security-sensitive information never logged or exposed in error messages

**Directory Structure Initialization:**
- Environment-specific directories created with proper naming conventions
- CSV processing directories established for isolated data handling
- Log directories initialized with environment-appropriate access permissions
- Backup and archive directories created for data persistence and recovery
- Directory permissions set appropriately for security and operational access

### **3. ENVIRONMENT ISOLATION ENFORCEMENT FLOW**

**Data Isolation Implementation:**
- Separate CSV processing directories prevent cross-environment data mixing
- Environment-specific log files maintain operational separation
- Database connections use different Airtable bases for complete data isolation
- File paths automatically include environment suffixes for clear identification
- Data processing queues isolated to prevent cross-environment contamination

**Service Isolation Configuration:**
- Webhook endpoints route to environment-specific ports and handlers
- API endpoints configured with environment-appropriate authentication
- Service instances run with separate process identifiers and configurations

**Process Isolation Management:**
- Cron jobs scheduled with non-overlapping execution times for resource management
- Environment variables passed to subprocesses for proper context inheritance
- Resource management isolated to prevent environment competition
- Process monitoring separated for independent operational visibility
- Cleanup operations scoped to environment-specific resources only

### **4. SAFETY MECHANISM ENFORCEMENT FLOW**

**Hostname-Based Safety Validation:**
- Current system hostname retrieved and analyzed for environment indicators

- Execution blocked unless explicit force flag provided to override safety

**Configuration Validation Safety:**
- API key format validation prevents execution with malformed credentials
