- Overall status reflects partial success

**Fallback Mechanism Implementation:**
- Primary data sources attempted first
- Secondary sources used on primary failure
- Default values applied for missing non-critical data
- Cached data used during service outages
- Manual processes documented as ultimate fallback
- Service degradation communicated to users

**Feature Toggle Management:**
- Non-critical features disabled during high load

**Backup and Recovery Procedures:**
- Critical data backed up before modifications
- Backup verification ensures recoverability
- Point-in-time recovery markers created
- Failed operations trigger restore procedures
