### Troubleshooting Guide
```javascript
// Common issues and solutions
const troubleshooting = {
    'missing_customer': 'Link property to customer record in Airtable Properties table',
    'invalid_hcp_id': 'Update customer record with valid HCP Customer ID',
    'address_mismatch': 'Verify HCP address belongs to assigned customer',
