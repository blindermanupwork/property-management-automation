## ‚è∞‚ùå **Incomplete View - Jobs Not Finished**

### **Purpose**: Shows jobs from past dates that aren't marked "Completed" - these need immediate attention

### **Scenario 1: Job Still Shows "In Progress" from June 10**
**Real Example:** 2065 W 1st Pl, Mesa - Kathy Nelson property

**What Happens:**
- Job `job_2257dc087ad94e2b9a9ca57065bca91c` for June 10 checkout
- Status shows "In Progress" - cleaner started at 8:13 AM
- It's now June 12 and job not marked complete
- Next guest already checked in

**Resolution Using This View:**
1. Open **‚è∞‚ùå Incomplete** view first thing in morning
2. See record ID 31690 with "On My Way Time" from June 12 at 8:13 AM
3. Call Laundry User (assignee) - confirm if cleaning was completed
4. If complete, update HCP status to "Completed"
5. Add note: "Cleaner confirmed completion, app issue prevented status update"

**Why This View Helps:** Catches jobs stuck in progress before complaints arise

---

### **Scenario 2: Yesterday's Job Still "Scheduled"** 
**Real Example:** 5950 N 78th St #123, Scottsdale - iTrip property

**What Happens:**
- Job `job_4107597a416949b8b3870231a299c829` scheduled for June 10
- Special note: "Owner Stay - The owner is staying in their home"
- Job still shows "Scheduled" status on June 12
- Owner already in property expecting clean space

**Resolution:**
1. Filter **‚è∞‚ùå Incomplete** view for past checkouts
2. See critical note: "Be sure to send charges for it in Slack ask Phil how much"
3. Notice access details: "Gate code #0518; Door Code 75736"
4. Call cleaner urgently - may have had access issues
5. If not cleaned, dispatch immediately with apology to owner

---

## ‚è∞‚ùì **Mismatch View - Schedule Sync Issues**

### **Purpose**: Identifies jobs where HCP schedule doesn't match Airtable expectations

### **Scenario 3: Job Scheduled for Wrong Time**
**Real Example:** 6536 E 5th St, Scottsdale - Mandie Brice property

**What Happens:**
- Job `job_617778dbd0774b789fb84d5515427b3c` for July 20
- Airtable expects 10:15 AM service
- HCP shows 12:05 PM scheduled
- Schedule Sync Details: "‚ö†Ô∏è TIME MISMATCH: Airtable shows 10:15 AM but HCP shows 12:00 PM"

**Resolution Using This View:**
1. Open **‚è∞‚ùì Mismatch** view
2. See Sync Status = "Wrong Time" for record ID 31696
3. Check if late checkout was approved - verify with property notes
4. Update Custom Service Time to match HCP if change was intentional
5. Or click "Add/Update Schedule" to fix HCP if error

**Why This View Helps:** Prevents cleaners arriving at wrong times

## ‚è∞üóëÔ∏è **Removed View - Canceled Reservations with Active Jobs**

3. Click HCP job link to check current status
4. Cancel the June 14 job in HCP

**Why This View Helps:** Prevents cleaners from showing up to canceled reservations

---

### **Scenario 5: Removed View Shows Empty - Good News!**
**Real Example:** Only one removed reservation with active job today

**What Happens:**
- Most days the Removed view might be empty
- This means no active jobs need canceling

- System working as designed

**Resolution:**
1. Check **‚è∞üóëÔ∏è Removed** view as part of morning routine
2. If empty, move on to next view
