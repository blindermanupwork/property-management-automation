# ICS Session Tracker Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The ICS processing duplicate detection was failing for Lodgify feeds because:

1. **Dynamic UIDs**: Lodgify generates different UIDs for the same reservation each time the ICS feed is fetched
2. **Session Tracker Placement**: The session tracker check was happening AFTER checking for existing records with the current UID
3. **Logic Flow Problem**: 
   - Event with UID-A creates a record for property/dates
   - Event with UID-B (same property/dates) doesn't find existing records because it has a different UID
   - Session tracker would have caught it, but the check was in the wrong place in the code flow

## Root Cause
In `process_with_memory_collection()`, the session tracker check was at line 1909-1914, which is AFTER the code checks for existing records with the current UID. This meant:
- If no records exist with the current UID, it would proceed to create a new record
- The session tracker check only happened for records that already had existing entries with that UID
- This allowed Lodgify's dynamic UIDs to bypass duplicate detection

## Fix Applied
Moved the session tracker check to happen BEFORE any record operations (now at lines 1897-1904):

```python
# Check for duplicates using session tracker FIRST
if session_tracker is not None and property_id:
    tracker_key = (property_id, event['dtstart'], event['dtend'], event['entry_type'])
    if tracker_key in session_tracker:
        stats['Duplicate_Ignored'] += 1
        logging.info(f'ðŸš« SESSION TRACKER: Skipping duplicate {original_uid} for property {property_id}, {event["dtstart"]} to {event["dtend"]}')
        continue
    session_tracker.add(tracker_key)
```

## How It Works Now
1. **First Event (UID-A)**:
   - Session tracker check: Key not found
   - Adds key to tracker: `(property_id, checkin, checkout, entry_type)`
   - Proceeds to create record

2. **Second Event (UID-B, same property/dates)**:
   - Session tracker check: Key already exists!
   - Logs "ðŸš« SESSION TRACKER: Skipping duplicate..."
   - `continue` statement skips ALL further processing
   - No duplicate record created

## Additional Protection
The system also has the `InMemoryCollector.add_create()` method that checks for duplicates within the batch, providing a second layer of protection.

## Testing
Created test scripts that demonstrate:
- 3 events with different UIDs but same property/dates/type
- Only 1 record is created
- 2 duplicates are prevented
- Session tracker successfully blocks duplicates regardless of UID

## Monitoring
To verify the fix is working:
1. Look for "ðŸš« SESSION TRACKER" messages in the ICS sync logs
2. Check that no duplicate records are being created for Lodgify properties
3. Monitor the `Duplicate_Ignored` count in sync statistics
