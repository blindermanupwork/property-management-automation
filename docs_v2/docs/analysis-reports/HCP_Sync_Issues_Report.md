### 2. Address Issues

#### üî¥ Duplicate HCP Addresses
- **6934 E Sandra Terrace, Scottsdale**
  - Has 2 address IDs in HCP: `adr_f1cc30f3f20c47378b88eabfc885e96d` and `adr_d65ccf61872c4cc298dafd63f13f0bbc`
  - Already updated property to use `adr_d65ccf61872c4cc298dafd63f13f0bbc`

#### ‚úÖ Correct Address IDs
All other properties have matching HCP Address IDs in Airtable.

### 3. Data Quality Issues

#### Duplicate Airtable Records
- **2065 W 1st Pl, Mesa (Kathy Nelson)**
  - 16 duplicate records for same reservation
  - 15 marked as "Old", 1 as "Modified"
  - Indicates Evolve import created duplicates

#### Special Cases
- **6913 E Moreland St** - Has note "DO NOT CLEAN OR DO INSPECTION"
- Several properties have "LONG TERM GUEST DEPARTING" flag (14+ day stays)
- Some have "Next Guest Unknown" vs specific next guest dates

## Recommendations

1. **Create Missing Jobs**
   - Use "Create Job & Sync Status" button for all 18 reservations without jobs
   - Pay attention to special instructions (e.g., DO NOT CLEAN)

2. **Fix Address Duplicates**
   - Resolve duplicate HCP addresses for 6934 E Sandra Terrace
   - Verify which address ID should be primary

3. **Clean Up Data**
   - Remove or consolidate duplicate Evolve import records
   - Standardize address formats between systems

4. **Update Reconciliation Script**
   - Script now matches by date only (not time)
   - Consider adding logic to handle duplicate addresses

5. **Process Order**
   - Start with earliest service dates (July 4)
   - Group by customer for efficiency (e.g., all iTrip properties)

## Next Steps

1. Run reconciliation script after creating jobs to verify matches
2. Monitor for new duplicate imports from Evolve
3. Consider automated job creation for reservations without conflicts
