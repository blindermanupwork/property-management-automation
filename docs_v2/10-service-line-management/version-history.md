- Created visual mermaid-flows.md
- Established version tracking

### Key Documentation Updates
- Documented complete service line hierarchy
- Added Unicode processing details
- Created visual assembly workflows
- Updated with current business rules

## Critical Feature Milestones

### Custom Instructions (v2.2.7)
**Breakthrough**: First user-defined content in service lines
- Enabled personalized cleaning instructions
- Maintained system flag integration
- Established character limit framework

### Owner Arrival Detection (v2.2.8)
**Enhancement**: Automatic detection of property owner returns
- Eliminated manual flag entry
- Improved property preparation standards
- Enhanced cleaner communication

### Unicode Support (v2.2.8)
**Global**: International character support
- Enabled multilingual custom instructions
- Supported emoji and special characters
- Maintained database compatibility

## Performance Evolution

### Version 2.2.8 Performance
- Service line assembly: <50ms
- Unicode processing: <10ms
- HCP API transmission: 1-2 seconds
- Character validation: <5ms

### Historical Performance
- v1.0: 200ms basic name generation
- v2.0: 150ms with flag detection
- v2.2: 100ms with optimization
- v2.2.8: 50ms with current efficiency

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Limitations
- Cannot update custom instructions after HCP job creation
- 200-character limit may truncate long instructions
- Manual HCP interface editing required for post-creation changes
- Same-day detection limited to property-date matching

### Workarounds
- Edit jobs directly in HousecallPro interface
- Preview service lines before job creation
- Use scheduled updates for flag changes
- Monitor truncation warnings

## Migration Notes

### From Version 2.0 to 2.2
- Custom instruction field added to Airtable
- Service line format changed to include custom text
- Character limits enforced consistently
- Flag detection automated

### From Version 2.2.5 to 2.2.8

- Error handling improved

## Technical Debt and Improvements

### Resolved Issues
- **Unicode Handling**: Proper UTF-8 support implemented
- **Character Counting**: Unicode-aware length calculation
- **Environment Isolation**: Complete dev/prod separation
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive fallback procedures

### Future Enhancements
- **Real-time Updates**: Live service line editing
- **Extended Character Limits**: Negotiate with HCP for larger limits

## Support Information

### Key Configuration Files
- Environment variables for character limits
- Airtable field mappings for custom instructions
- HCP API endpoints for line item updates
- Flag detection thresholds and rules

### Troubleshooting Guide
```javascript
// Common issues and solutions
const troubleshooting = {
    'truncated_instructions': 'Check 200-character limit, edit in HCP if needed',
    'missing_flags': 'Verify owner detection logic and stay duration calculation',
    'unicode_errors': 'Check UTF-8 encoding in database and API transmission',
    'update_failures': 'Confirm HCP API permissions and rate limits'
};
```

### Monitoring Alerts
- High truncation rates indicate user education needed
- API failures suggest integration issues
- Unicode errors point to encoding problems
- Performance degradation indicates optimization opportunities
