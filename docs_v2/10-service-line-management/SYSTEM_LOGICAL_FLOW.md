# Service Line Management - Complete System Logical Flow

## Overview
This document describes the complete operational flow of the Service Line Management system, from custom instruction input through flag detection, service line assembly, character limit enforcement, and HousecallPro integration.

## Primary Data Flow

### 1. Custom Instructions Input Processing

#### User Input Reception
When users enter custom instructions in Airtable:
- Field "Custom Service Line Instructions" captures raw input
- System accepts all UTF-8 characters including emojis and accents
- No character filtering or restrictions applied during input
- Whitespace normalization performed automatically
- Empty submissions result in null field values

#### Input Validation and Cleaning
During instruction processing:
- Null and undefined values handled gracefully
- Leading and trailing whitespace removed
- Empty strings after trimming converted to null
- Unicode character validation ensures proper encoding
- Length validation triggers truncation warnings

### 2. Special Flag Detection Flow

#### Owner Arrival Detection Process
System analyzes reservation context for owner blocks:
- Query executed for blocks at same property after checkout
- Search window spans 48 hours from checkout date
- Block check-in dates compared to guest checkout
- Owner arrival flagged when block starts 0-1 days after checkout
- Airtable "Owner Arriving" field updated automatically

#### Long-Term Guest Analysis
Stay duration calculation triggers extended service flags:
- Check-in and checkout dates extracted from reservation
- Duration calculated in full days using timezone-aware math
- Threshold comparison determines if stay qualifies as long-term
- 14+ day stays trigger "LONG TERM GUEST DEPARTING" flag
- Flag suppressed if owner arrival detected simultaneously

#### Same-Day Turnover Detection
Next guest analysis identifies urgent turnover situations:
- Property schedule queried for reservations on checkout date
- Active reservations filtered to exclude cancelled bookings
- Check-in timing analyzed to determine urgency level
- Same-day detection triggers "SAME DAY" service prefix
- Service duration adjustments applied automatically

### 3. Service Line Assembly Process

#### Component Collection Phase
System gathers all service line components:
- Custom instructions retrieved from Airtable field
- Special flags collected from detection algorithms
- Base service name generated from reservation details
- Next guest information obtained from schedule analysis
- Service type preserved from Airtable configuration

#### Hierarchical Assembly Execution
Components combined following strict precedence rules:
- Custom instructions positioned first when present
- System flags arranged by priority order
- Base service name always included as foundation
- Separator " - " inserted between all components
- Final assembly validated for completeness

#### Character Limit Enforcement
Assembled service line undergoes length validation:
- Primary 200-character limit checked first
- Intelligent truncation applied preserving critical components
- Custom instructions truncated before flags or base service
- Word boundary preservation attempted during truncation
- Ellipsis indicator added when content truncated

### 4. HousecallPro Integration Flow

#### Job Creation Service Line Assignment
During initial job creation process:
- Complete service line becomes first line item name
- HCP job structure built with service line as primary descriptor
- Line item configured as "labor" type with unit quantity
- Schedule information attached to job record
- Customer and address references linked properly

#### API Transmission and Validation
Service line transmitted to HousecallPro:
- UTF-8 encoding maintained throughout transmission
- HCP API character limits validated before sending
- Fallback truncation applied if primary limits exceeded
- Retry logic handles temporary API failures
- Success confirmation validates proper job creation

#### Post-Creation Update Limitations
After job creation completion:
- Custom instruction updates not supported via API
- Direct HCP interface editing required for changes
- System tracks limitation and provides user guidance
- Webhook updates limited to significant status changes only
- Manual intervention documented for complex modifications

### 5. Environment-Specific Processing

#### Development Environment Operations
Development instance processes service lines independently:
- Separate Airtable base containing dev reservations
- Boris's HCP account receives dev job creations
- Dev-specific sync script handles service line updates
- Environment isolation prevents cross-contamination
- Test data used for validation and debugging

#### Production Environment Operations
Production instance handles live customer data:
- Production Airtable base with real reservations
- Third-party HCP account manages actual service jobs
- Production sync script ensures reliable operations
- Live data requires enhanced error handling
- Customer impact considerations guide all changes

### 6. Scheduled Update Operations

#### Batch Processing Execution
Every 4 hours automated updates execute:
- All active reservations retrieved from Airtable
- Owner arrival detection re-run for accuracy
- Long-term guest analysis updated with current data
- Flag changes trigger service line rebuilds
- HCP jobs updated when service lines change

#### Flag Change Detection
System identifies when flags need updating:
- Previous flag states compared to current analysis
- New owner blocks detected through date proximity
- Stay duration recalculated for accuracy
- Flag addition or removal triggers update cascade
- Change logging provides audit trail

#### Service Line Rebuild Process
When flag changes require service line updates:
- New service line assembled with current components
- Character limits re-applied to updated content
- HCP API called to update existing job line items
- Update success validated through response checking
- Failure recovery procedures initiated when needed

### 7. Real-Time Processing Triggers

#### Airtable Field Change Detection
System responds to field modifications immediately:
- Custom instruction changes trigger rebuild process
- Next guest date updates affect base service names
- Service type changes propagate to service lines
- Property changes require complete re-analysis
- Status changes may affect processing eligibility

#### Reservation Timeline Changes
Date modifications trigger comprehensive re-evaluation:
- New check-in dates affect long-term calculations
- Checkout changes impact owner arrival detection
- Schedule conflicts require same-day re-analysis
- Timeline shifts cascade through dependent logic
- Related reservations analyzed for impacts

### 8. Error Handling and Recovery

#### Input Processing Errors
Invalid or problematic input handled gracefully:
- Malformed Unicode characters converted to safe alternatives
- Excessive length triggers automatic truncation procedures
- Missing required data substituted with defaults
- Encoding errors logged with fallback processing
- User notification provided for data quality issues

#### API Integration Failures
HousecallPro communication errors managed systematically:
- Network timeouts trigger exponential backoff retry
- API rate limiting handled with queue management
- Authentication failures escalated to admin notification
- Data validation errors reported with context
- Service degradation alerts generated when appropriate

#### Service Line Assembly Failures
Component assembly problems resolved automatically:
- Missing components substituted with safe defaults
- Flag detection failures result in no-flag fallback
- Base service name generation uses minimal safe content
- Character limit violations trigger emergency truncation
- Assembly errors logged with diagnostic information
