- Added detailed SYSTEM_LOGICAL_FLOW.md
- Created visual mermaid-flows.md
- Established version tracking

### Key Documentation Updates
- Documented all cleanup scripts and their purposes
- Added detailed UID generation algorithms
- Created visual workflow diagrams
- Updated with current business rules

## Critical Bug Fixes

### Record 37717 UID Change Bug (v2.2.8)
**Issue**: When Airbnb changes both UID and dates, duplicate detection tracks new dates but old record has different dates, causing incorrect removal.

**Root Cause**: Duplicate tracking by property-date didn't account for simultaneous UID and date changes.

**Fix**: Enhanced duplicate tracking to include all related record dates when duplicate detected.

### Future Check-in Filter Issue (v2.2.7)
**Issue**: Removal detection skips all future check-ins, missing legitimate removals.

**Impact**: 0 removals reported despite missing events in feeds.

**Resolution**: Revised filter logic to properly handle future reservations.

### Composite UID Lookup Complexity (v2.1.0)
**Issue**: Dual indexing created performance overhead and lookup confusion.

**Mitigation**: Optimized query patterns and added clear lookup strategies.

## Performance Improvements

### Version 2.2.8 Performance
- UID lookup: <50ms average
- Duplicate detection: <200ms per record
- Batch cleanup: 100 records/second
- Memory usage: 95% reduction from v1.0

### Historical Performance
- v1.0: 2-3 seconds per duplicate check
- v2.0: 500ms with property-date checking
- v2.1: 300ms with composite UIDs
- v2.2: 200ms with optimizations

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Limitations
- Manual review required for complex conflicts
- Performance degrades with very large batches
- Cross-system authority conflicts need human decision
- Historical data cleanup requires careful validation

### Planned Improvements
- AI-powered duplicate detection for fuzzy matching
- Real-time duplicate prevention during data entry
- Advanced pattern recognition for UID changes
- Automated authority resolution based on data quality

## Migration Notes

### From Version 1.x to 2.x
- Status field usage changed significantly
- Cleanup procedures automated
- Database indexes required for performance

### From Version 2.0 to 2.2
- Composite UID structure introduced
- Session tracking added
