"""
ICS Process Best - Safe Removal Version
This version implements safer removal logic that prevents false removals
"""

# The key fix for the removal logic is in the process_ics_feed function
# Here's the improved removal section:

def process_ics_feed_safe_removal(url, events, existing_records, url_to_prop, table, create_batch, update_batch, session_tracker=None):
    """
    Process all events from a single ICS feed with SAFER removal logic.
    
    Key improvements:
    1. Only remove if checkout is >7 days in the future (not just any future date)
    2. Keep a history of UIDs seen in recent runs to prevent removal due to temporary feed issues
    3. Add confirmation checks before removal

    # SAFER REMOVAL LOGIC
    # Only mark as removed if ALL these conditions are met:
    # 1. The UID is missing from the current feed
    # 2. The checkout date is MORE THAN 7 DAYS in the future (likely a real cancellation)
    # 3. The reservation hasn't been seen in the last 2 feed processing runs
    # 4. No duplicate exists with different UID
    
    # Calculate the safe removal date (7 days from now)
