## 🔄 **COMPLETE BUSINESS PROCESS FLOW**

### 1. **Data Ingestion Sources**
```
A. iTrip Email Processing (50+ CSVs daily)
   Gmail → OAuth → Download → CSV Processing → Airtable

B. Evolve Portal Scraping (Daily)
   Selenium → Partner Portal → CSV Export → Processing → Airtable

C. ICS Calendar Feeds (246 feeds - Production)
   HTTP Fetch → iCalendar Parse → Date Filter → Airtable
   Sources: Airbnb, VRBO, Booking.com, Hospitable, OwnerRez, Guesty

D. Webhook Updates (Real-time)
   HCP Webhooks → Signature Verify → Airtable Updates
```

### 2. **Business Rules Engine**

#### Same-Day Turnover Detection Logic
```python
# Core Algorithm (icsProcess.py:865-873)
for checkout_date in checkout_dates:
    if checkout_date in checkin_dates and checkout_date != checkin_date:
        reservation["same_day_turnover"] = True
        service_name = f"{service_type} STR SAME DAY"
```

#### Service Line Custom Instructions
```javascript
// Implementation (hcp_sync.js:264-285)
const maxCustomLength = 200;
if (customInstructions.length > maxCustomLength) {
  customInstructions = customInstructions.substring(0, maxCustomLength - 3) + '...';
}
final_service_name = `${customInstructions} - ${baseServiceName}`;
```

#### Pricing Logic
```javascript
// Template-based pricing (hcp_sync.js:374-421)
Job Types:
- Turnover: jbt_20319ca089124b00af1b8b40150424ed
- Return Laundry: jbt_434c62f58d154eb4a968531702b96e8e  
- Inspection: jbt_b5d9457caf694beab5f350d42de3e57f
```

### 3. **Time Zone Management Strategy**
```python
# Three-Zone Approach
1. PST/MST for Logging: pytz.timezone('America/Phoenix')
2. Arizona Time for Business: No daylight saving adjustment
3. UTC for API Communications: ISO format standard
```

### 4. **Decision Trees & Automation Triggers**

#### Job Creation Decision Tree
```
1. Reservation Detected → Property Mapping Required
   ├─ Property Found → Service Type Determination
   │  ├─ Same-Day Checkout? → STR SAME DAY service
   │  ├─ Regular Turnover → STR Next Guest {date}
   │  └─ Inspection/Maintenance → Specialized service
   └─ Property Not Found → Manual Review Required

2. Service Creation → Custom Instructions Check
   ├─ Instructions Present → Prepend to service name (200 char limit)
   └─ No Instructions → Base service name only

3. Job Assignment → HCP Integration
   ├─ Valid Template → Job Created
   ├─ Missing Template → Error Log
   └─ API Failure → Retry Logic (3 attempts)
```

#### Webhook Processing Flow
```
1. Webhook Received → Authentication Check
   ├─ HCP Signature Valid → Process Update
   ├─ Servativ Forwarded → Process Update  
   └─ Invalid Auth → Log & Return 200

2. Event Type Routing
   ├─ job.appointment.* → Appointment Handler
   ├─ job.status.* → Status Update Handler
   └─ job.rescheduled → Schedule Update Handler

3. Airtable Update → Sync Status Tracking
   ├─ Success → Update sync fields
   └─ Failure → Error logging
```

## 🚨 **CRITICAL BUSINESS ISSUES DISCOVERED**

### 1. **Production Data Contamination (URGENT)**
**Issue:** Test customer "Boris Blinderman Test" exists in production HCP
- **Customer ID:** cus_f87d34d6dcbf4952b50749050bccf6a2
- **Job Value:** $150.00 (test data)
- **Address:** 123 Test Rd, #2D, Costa Mesa, CA 92626
- **Impact:** Corrupts revenue reporting, scheduling, and customer communications

## 🔧 **WEBHOOK SYSTEM ANALYSIS**

### Dual Authentication Architecture
```python
# Two-layer security (webhook.py:179-182)
1. HCP Signature Verification: HMAC-SHA256 with timestamp
2. Servativ Forwarding Auth: X-Internal-Auth header validation
```

### Event Processing Capabilities
**Supported Events:**
- `job.appointment.scheduled` - Employee assignment updates
- `job.appointment.rescheduled` - Time changes  
- `job.appointment.appointment_discarded` - Cancellations
- `job.appointment.appointment_pros_assigned` - Team updates
- `job.status.*` - Work status changes

### Error Handling Strategy
```python
# Always returns 200 to prevent webhook disabling
return jsonify({"status": "success"}), 200
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents HCP from disabling webhooks on errors
- Maintains data flow during temporary issues
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging
