# Security Cleanup Summary

## What Was Done

1. **Removed hardcoded credentials from current files**:
   - Updated all scripts to use environment variables
   - Created `.env.example` template
   - Fixed startup scripts

2. **Cleaned git history**:
   - Ran multiple passes of `git filter-branch`
   - Replaced sensitive strings with "REDACTED-*" placeholders
   - Cleaned specific files known to contain secrets

3. **Files cleaned**:
   - `src/automation/config.py`
   - `scripts/CSVtoAirtable/config.py`
   - `tools/debug-mcp-params.cjs`
   - `tools/hcp-mcp-dev/debug-mcp-params.cjs`
   - `tools/start-airtable-mcp.sh`
   - `tools/test-airtable-mcp.js`

## Remaining Issues

There are still 7 occurrences of sensitive strings in the git history. These appear to be in:
- Older commits that may be referenced by remote branches
- Possible packed objects that weren't cleaned

## Next Steps

1. **Force push to remote** (CRITICAL):
   ```bash
   git push --force --all
   git push --force --tags
   ```

2. **Notify team members** to re-clone the repository

3. **Rotate ALL compromised credentials**:
   - Airtable API keys (both dev and prod)
   - HousecallPro tokens (both dev and prod)
   - OpenAI API key
   - All webhook secrets

4. **Additional cleanup** (if needed):
   - Consider using BFG Repo-Cleaner for more thorough cleaning
   - May need to delete and recreate the repository if secrets persist

## Prevention

- Never commit `.env` files
- Always use environment variables for credentials
- Review code before committing
- Use git pre-commit hooks to detect secrets
